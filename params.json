{"name":"BFP","tagline":"A Brute Force Protection System","body":"BFP is your first line of defence against brute force attacks with a focus on low resource usage and high concurrency.  It’s open source and has simple APIs for several common languages.\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\n\r\nThe core of the system is a lightweight application that tracks repeated requests for usernames, passwords and any other type of data that can be tracked in a request (such as the attacker’s IP address).  You’re notified anytime you receive a request that appears to be an attack.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that BFP only tells you **which** requests look like attacks and not **what** to do about it.  For more information on how to deal with brute force attacks, [see here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nBFP is designed to be as flexible as possible by imposing as few requirements as possible.  Unless you compile from source, there are no dependencies to run BFP.\r\n\r\n### Binaries\r\n\r\nThere are binaries available for download for 64-bit Linux, Mac OS X and Windows on the [release page](https://github.com/JamesOwenHall/BruteForceProtection/releases).  For other operating systems or architectures, you’ll need to build from source.\r\n\r\n### From Source\r\n\r\nTo build BFP from source, you’ll need to have the [Go compiler](http://golang.org), as well as Git.  Once you have those, run the following commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go get github.com/JamesOwenHall/BruteForceProtection/core\r\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/JamesOwenHall/BruteForceProtection/core\r\n$ go build -o bfp\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/JamesOwenHall/bfp/wiki/Getting-Started).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
